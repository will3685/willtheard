# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

Early in the academic journey, I strove to learn more about statistics, numbers, programming, automation, and technology in general with special interest in Web and Mobile development. So I decided to turn Learning Code as an obsession of mine to be able to help designers, small agencies, and businesses bring their ideas to life. Outside of formal education, I am the earner of the Harvard CS50 certifications. 4+ years of experience with Ruby and JavaScript; 3+ years of experience with Python & SQL; 2+ years of experience with Pentaho Data Integration and Data Analytics. I am always down for new challenges! My second most precious commodity in life, I invest time."
